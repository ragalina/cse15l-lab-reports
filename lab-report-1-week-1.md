## Download Visual Studio Code 
![VS Code Image](lab-report-1/1-vs-code.png)

I already had VS Code installed on my laptop, so I simply launched the application. 

## Remotely Connecting
Use the [Account Lookup](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php) to find your CSE 15L username. It should look like "cs15lfa22xx", with the xx being any two random letters. 

After finding your username, reset your password. Keep it simple, since you won't be able to see what you're typing into the terminal!

Once your password is reset (can take 15-60 minutes), login to your account via the terminal. 

The command is:
    ssh cs15lfa22nr@ieng6.ucsd.edu

Once prompted, enter your password. If the password doesn't work, try typing it somewhere else and copy-pasting it into the terminal (make sure you don't copy-paste any extra spaces).

You should then see this text:

The 201, 202, & 203 refer to the 3 computers that you can log in to. The number of users may vary when compared to when others logged in, but the load averages are fairly consistent between people.

## Run Some Commands
After you log in, try running some commands in the remote system!

Here is what I tried:
![Image of Commands](lab-report-1/1-basic-commands.png)

    cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/public/hello.txt

This prints a .txt file that is stored remotely.

    cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lfa22/public/hello.txt~/ragalina

This copies that remotely-stored file to my personal laptop.

**Some other commands**
- ```ls``` 
    - lists the files and directories in the current directory.

- ```ls -a``` 
    - also shows hidden files.

- ```ls -lat``` 
    - provides more information on each file.

- ```ctrl + D```
    - this logs you out.

## Copying Files over SSH with ```scp```

To copy files from your personal device to your account on the remotely-accessed computer, we use the ```scp``` command.

The full command is:
    scp filename.java cs15lfa22nr@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/

After entering this, you'll have to sign in with your password. Once you use ```ssh``` to login again, you should see the file listed.

To test this out, we created a practice java file, WhereAmI.java.

    class WhereAmI {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(System.getProperty("os.name"));
        System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.name"));
        System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.home"));
        System.out.println(System.getProperty("user.dir"));
    }
    }

When run on my personal device, this is WhereAmI.java's output:

![WhereAmI.java on Mac](lab-report-1/1-whereAmI-on-mac.png)

Here is the output from the remote system:
![WhereAmI.java on Remote System](lab-report-1/1-WhereAmI-on-remote.png)

The ```.getProperty``` function in WhereAmI.java shows the different operating systems and locations of the file on the client vs. the server.

## SSH Keys
To make logging in and copying files faster, we can save our password in ssh keys. The public key file is stored on my account for the remote access system while the private one is stored on my personal device. When both of these files can be found, they can serve as a substitute for the password. 

Here is the code I ran:
![SSH Key Image](lab-report-1/1-ssh-keys.png)

At the end, after I inputted my password, the "id_rsa.pub" means that the command was successful.

## Making Remote Running *Even* Easier

You can minimize the number of keystrokes needed by simply using the up arrow to go to the previous command. 

In this screenshot, updating the WhereAmI.java file, compiling, running, and copying it to the remote system would only take 10 keystrokes â€” 1 to save the file, and 3 up-arrows for each following command.
